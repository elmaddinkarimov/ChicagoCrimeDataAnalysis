# Presentation Guidelines

You are free to structure your presentations to your liking, but students tend to have success with the following format.

* Title Slide

  * Include the name of the Project and Group Members

* Motivation & Summary Slide

  * Define the core message or hypothesis of your project.
  * Describe the questions you asked, and _why_ you asked them
  * Describe whether you were able to answer these questions to your satisfaction, and briefly summarize your findings

* Questions & Data

  * Elaborate on the questions you asked, describing what kinds of data you needed to answer them, and where you found it

* Data Cleanup & Exploration

  * Describe the exploration and cleanup process
  * Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
  * Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during exploration, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Data Analysis

  * Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during analysis, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook

* Discussion

  * Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?

* Post Mortem

  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them
  * Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?

* Questions
  * Open-floor Q&A with the audience
  
  
  # Technical Requirements

The technical requirements for Project 1 are as follows.

* [ ] Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process

* [ ] Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**

* [ ] Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)

* [ ] Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation

* [ ] Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions

* [ ] Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
