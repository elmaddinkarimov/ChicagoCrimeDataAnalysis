Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process
Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**
Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
